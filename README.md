			Biff the Understudy - Tutorial NPC for SoD 
					by jastey 


This mod is meant as a tutorial for modders how to script the basic structure needed for an SoD NPC.
Biff is a "fighter" with STR 9, DEX 9, CON 9, INT 9, WIS 9, CHA 9, no items, no portrait, and no soundset. The mod is not meant for playing, but knock yourself out! The mod should definitely *work* in SoD.

The "xxbiff.ini" file is for ALIEN's Project Infinity automated installer:
